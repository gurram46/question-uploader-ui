Here’s what the backend expects from the frontend.

Endpoints

- POST /uploadquestion (multipart/form-data)
    - Text fields (required): subjectName, topicName, questionText, difficultyId (number > 0).
    - Options: option1..option4 (texts, optional), option1Correct..option4Correct (booleans or “true”/“false”).
    - Explanation: explanation (optional).
    - Files (optional, 0–1 each): questionImage, option1Image, option2Image, option3Image, option4Image, explanationImage.
    - Constraint: at least one of option1 or option1Image must be present.
    - Important: send difficultyId as the numeric DB id (not hashed, not a label).
    - Important: send difficultyId as the numeric DB id (not hashed, not a label).
-
GET /getquestions
    - No input. Returns flattened rows. Fields include:
    - `question_id` hashed string; `difficulty_id` numeric; `difficulty_level` number; `difficulty_type` string.
-
Frontend should group rows by question_id to assemble questions with options.
-
DELETE /deletequestion (application/json)
    - Body: { "questionId": "<hashed question_id from GET>" }.
-
GET /getdifficulties
    - No input. Returns array with difficulty_id hashed, difficulty_level number (1–3), difficulty_type string.
-
POST /createdifficulty (application/json)
    - Body: { "difficultyLevel": number (1|2|3), "difficultyType": string }.

Notes

- CORS is enabled; no auth required.
- For /uploadquestion, the backend uses difficultyId (numeric) to link to difficulties. The difficulty_id in /getquestions is numeric; the one in /
getdifficulties is hashed. Use the numeric id when posting a question.
