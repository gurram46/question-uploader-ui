# Security and Code Quality Issues - Question Uploader UI

## Overview
This document outlines security vulnerabilities, potential runtime errors, and code quality issues identified in the Question Uploader UI application. These issues should be addressed to improve the application's security, stability, and maintainability.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Object Injection Vulnerabilities
- **Location**: Multiple locations in file upload service
- **Risk**: High - Potential for unauthorized data access or manipulation
- **Details**: ESLint has flagged several instances where user-controlled input could be used as object keys, creating security vulnerabilities
- **Recommendation**: Review all object property access patterns and implement proper validation for dynamic keys

### 2. Information Leakage
- **Location**: Multiple files across the codebase
- **Risk**: Medium - Debug information could expose internal workings
- **Details**: Console.log statements throughout the application could leak sensitive information in production environments
- **Recommendation**: Remove or properly guard debug logging statements

## Runtime Error Risks

### 1. Potential Null Reference Exceptions
- **Location**: File upload service and data processing utilities
- **Risk**: High - Could cause application crashes
- **Details**: Use of non-null assertion operators (!) that could fail if values are actually null
- **Recommendation**: Replace with proper null checks and error handling

### 2. React Hook Dependency Issues
- **Location**: Toast notification hook
- **Risk**: Medium - Could lead to stale data or unexpected behavior
- **Details**: Missing dependencies in useCallback hooks that may cause incorrect behavior
- **Recommendation**: Add missing dependencies to dependency arrays

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Type Safety Concerns
- **Location**: API service and error handlers
- **Risk**: Medium - Reduced code reliability and maintainability
- **Details**: Use of 'any' type in several places bypasses TypeScript's type checking
- **Recommendation**: Define proper interfaces and types for all data structures

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- **Location**: API service and file upload functions
- **Risk**: Medium - Poor user experience during failures
- **Details**: Generic error messages and silent failure handling in some cases
- **Recommendation**: Implement more specific error handling with user-friendly messages

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Address object injection vulnerabilities
   - Remove information-leaking console statements

2. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Fix null reference risks
   - Correct React hook dependencies
   - Improve type safety

3. **Long-term Enhancements**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Refactor complex components for better maintainability

## Next Steps

This analysis should be used as a roadmap for improving the application's code quality and security posture. Each identified issue should be addressed according to its risk level and impact on the application's functionality.
